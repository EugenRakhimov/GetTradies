## Job stories ##
- A client has an odd job that requires a tradesperson to fix.  They can take a photo with their smart phone which they can upload to the site with a brief description of the task, along with their location and the timeframe in which they need someone to attend to their job.
- A registered tradesperson can filter jobs by their type (according to their skills), location and availability.  They can then bid on jobs they'd like to attend.
- The client can then check the reviews of tradespeople bidding on their job and assess quotes against their budget to select the tradesperson they'd like to service their job.
